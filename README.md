# login-register
This is the code for my tutorial on login and register system using html, css, php and mysql.
Access the tutorial here: https://kelvince.com/articles/user-login-and-registration-system-using-php-and-mysql for a step by step reference.

Create the database with the name "login" then import the 'users.sql'.
Move the files in the web directory of your server and access the index.php using localhost/$thenameofyourfolder$/index.php.
Click on the signup and create an account with your details.
Try logging out and logging in using your details and the scripts should work just fine.

Customize the scripts to your needs and share it to your friends.
